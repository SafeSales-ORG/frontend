/**
 * `useCurrentSeller` — the logged-in seller's SafeSale profile.
 *
 * Stored separately from the Nostr session (`useCurrentUser`) because
 * it carries SafeSale-specific data the backend gave us at signup:
 *
 *   - `id` — the Prisma cuid the backend uses as `sellerId`
 *   - `npub` — the seller's bech32 public key (also stored by Nostrify)
 *   - `handle` — the URL-safe SafeSale handle
 *   - `name` — display name
 *
 * Persisted to `localStorage` under `safesale:seller` so the dashboard
 * works across reloads without an extra `GET /api/sellers/:handle`
 * round-trip. Cleared on logout (see `clearSeller`).
 *
 * Why this and not `useAuthor()`? `useAuthor` queries Nostr for kind 0
 * profile metadata. SafeSale's seller record is on a Postgres DB,
 * keyed by npub; the two will rhyme but the SafeSale handle isn't a
 * Nostr concept and shouldn't be tied to relay availability.
 *
 * Set by `Onboarding.tsx` after a successful `apiClient.createSeller`.
 * Reset to `null` when the user logs out.
